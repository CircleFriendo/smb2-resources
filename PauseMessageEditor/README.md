Select the level and area you want a message to appear in, then type your message into the message box. Once you have typed all the messages you want, click export and save the .asm file. Patch the .asm file to your rom using xkas-plus. If you want to edit the messages again later, you can re-import the .asm file to edit or add new messages.
